# Project guardrails for Cursor

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- ESLint (flat config) + Prettier
- SASS with BEM naming convention
- React Router for navigation
- Prefer functional components + hooks
- Keep components small and typed (no "any" unless justified)

## Code Style

- Follow Prettier; no manual style rules that conflict with Prettier
- Use named exports when practical
- Strict TS: no implicit any; avoid tslint-like disable unless justified in comment
- Enforce accessibility via eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
- use Type not Interface
- React components use PascalCase
- folder name use camelCase or kebab-case
- constant use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- function and variable use camelCase

## Architecture

- UI components put in `src/components/`
- Pages put in `src/pages/`
- Internal shared utilities put in `src/utils/`
- External libraries and contexts put in `src/lib/`
- Type definitions put in `src/types/`
- Styles put in `src/styles/`
- Avoid deep prop drilling; use context only when needed

## Performance

- React.memo for pure visual components
- useCallback/useMemo for stable refs in heavy lists
- Code-split routes or big chunks

## Testing (optional later)

- Plan for vitest + @testing-library/react

## DevEx

- Every new file must pass `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm tsc`
- Dark mode support with system preference detection
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
